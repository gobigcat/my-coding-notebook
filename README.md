# C++ Practice Notebook 📓

This folder contains practice exercises written during my C++ + ML self-study journey.

Each file focuses on a small concept to build up gradually toward real ML code.

## 📁 Exercise Files

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| 01_main.cpp | Basic vector operations, implement linear regression math | |

## ✅ Why I’m Doing This

I want to refresh my C++ skills while also exploring the fundamentals of ML from scratch, using code to ground my understanding.
